# ETJ
Electronic Tip Jar (ETJ) is an Arduino project for managing positive/negative thoughts and behaviours.

## Description
Combined with a 3D printed case this project will allow you to keep a total of your negative and positive thoughts and behaviours. It will display the totals on the LCD and is designed to be reset at the end of each week and the total jotted down elsewhere. It's a great way to improve your mindfulness skills by helping you to modify your thoughts, behaviours and habits.

## The Totals
The project will track 2 negative totals and 3 positive totals, use them as you will but this is what I found most helpful.
 - Negative  1  =  A negative thought/behaviour you catch at the time.
 - Negative  2  =  A negative thought/behaviour you catch later on.
 - Positive  5  =  A positive thought/behaviour.
 - Positive 10  =  Taking a small step outside your comfort zone.
 - Positive 20  =  Taking a large step outside your comfort zone.
